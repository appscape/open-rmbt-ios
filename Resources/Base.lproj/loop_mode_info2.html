        <p>
            In the case of high demand or a high number of tests in a specific area, loop mode
            tests may be rejected by the test system in order to avoid overload. It should be
            noted that the loop mode is intended (only) for usage within the EU and EFTA states.
        </p>
        <p>
            Please note that the loop modus consumes a huge amount of data. With high-speed
            connections 10 tests can consume 1GB or more. Therefore it is highly recommended to
            run the loop mode only with a true flat rate tariff where additional traffic des not
            generate additional costs.
        </p>
        <p>
            The loop mode also consumes a lot of battery power. Between the loop tests, the loop
            mode keeps GPS and the display active, thus the battery is drained much faster
            than in standbymode. In addition, tests also consume power. Therefore the loop
            mode should be used only if an extended power supply is available.
